            <p>On behalf of the great state of Illinois, crossroads of a nation, land of Lincoln, let me express my deep gratitude for the privilege of addressing this convention. Tonight is a particular honor for me because, let’s face it, my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely. My father was a foreign student, born and raised in a small village in Kenya. He grew up herding goats, went to school in a tin-roof shack. His father, my grandfather, was a cook, a domestic servant.<br>伟大的伊利诺伊州既是全国的交通枢纽，也是林肯的故乡，作为州代表，今天我将在大会致词，并为自己能有幸获此殊荣而倍感骄傲和自豪。今晚对我而言颇不寻常，我们得承认，我能站在这里本身就已意义非凡。我父亲是一个外国留学生，他原本生于肯尼亚的一个小村庄，并在那里长大成人。他小的时候还放过羊，上的学校简陋不堪，屋顶上仅有块铁皮来遮风挡雨。而他的父亲，也就是我的祖父，不过是个普通的厨子，还做过家佣。</p>
<p>But my grandfather had larger dreams for his son. Through hard work and perseverance my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place: America, which stood as a beacon of freedom and opportunity to so many who had come before. While studying here, my father met my mother. She was born in a town on the other side of the world, in Kansas. Her father worked on oil rigs and farms through most of the Depression. The day after Pearl Harbor he signed up for duty, joined Patton’s army and marched across Europe. Back home, my grandmother raised their baby and went to work on a bomber assembly line. After the war, they studied on the GI Bill, bought a house through FHA, and moved west in search of opportunity.<br>但祖父对父亲抱以厚望。凭借不懈的努力和坚忍不拔的毅力，父亲荣获赴美留学的机会，而且还拿到奖学金。美国这片神奇的土地，对于很多踏上这片国土的人而言，意味着自由和机遇。还在留学期间，父亲与母亲不期而遇。母亲来自完全不同的另一个世界，她生于堪萨斯的一个小镇。大萧条时期，外祖父为谋生计，曾在石油钻井打工，还曾在农场务农。日军偷袭珍珠港后的第二天，他就自愿应征入伍，在巴顿将军麾下，转战南北，横扫欧洲。在后方的家中，外祖母含辛茹苦，抚养子女，并在轰炸机装配线上找了份活计。战后，依据士兵福利法案, 他们通过联邦住宅管理局购置了一套房子，并举家西迁，谋求更大发展。</p>
<p>And they, too, had big dreams for their daughter, a common dream, born of two continents. My parents shared not only an improbable love; they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation. They would give me an African name, Barack, or “blessed,” believing that in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success. They imagined me going to the best schools in the land, even though they weren’t rich, because in a generous America you don’t have to be rich to achieve your potential. They are both passed away now. Yet, I know that, on this night, they look down on me with pride.<br>他们对自己的女儿也寄予厚望，两家人虽然身在不同的非洲和美洲大陆，却有着共同的梦想。我的父母不仅不可思议地彼此相爱，而且还对这个国家有了不移的信念。他们赐予我一个非洲名字，巴拉克，意为“上天福佑”, 因为他们相信，在如此包容的国度中，这样的名字不应成为成功的羁绊。尽管他们生活并不宽裕，还是想方设法让我接受当地最好的教育，因为在这样一个富足的国度中，无论贫富贵贱，都同样有机会发展个人的潜力。现在他们都已不在人世，不过，我知道，他们的在天之灵，此时此刻正在骄傲地关注着我。</p>
<p>I stand here today, grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware that my parents’ dreams live on in my precious daughters. I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and that, in no other country on earth, is my story even possible. Tonight, we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation, not because of the height of our skyscrapers, or the power of our military, or the size of our economy. Our pride is based on a very simple premise, summed up in a declaration made over two hundred years ago, “We hold these truths to he self-evident, that all men are created equal. That they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights. That among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.”<br>今天，我站在这里，对自己身上这种特殊的血统而心怀感激，而且我知道父母的梦想将在我的宝贝女儿身上继续延续；我站在这里，深知自己的经历只是千百万美国故事中的沧海一粟，更深知自己无法忘却那些更早踏上这片土地的先人，因为若不是在美国，我的故事无论如何都不可能发生。今夜，我们聚集一堂，再次证明这个国度的伟大之处，而这一切并不在于鳞次栉比的摩天大厦，也不在于傲视群雄的军备实力，更不在于稳健雄厚的经济实力。我们的自豪与荣耀来自一个非常简单的前提，两百多年前，它在一个著名的宣言中得以高度的概括：“我们认为以下真理不言而喻，人生来平等，造物主赐与他们以下不可剥夺的权利：生命、自由和对幸福的追求。”</p>
<p>That is the true genius of America, a faith in the simple dreams of its people, the insistence on small miracles. That we can tuck in our children at night and know they are fed and clothed and safe from harm. That we can say what we think, write what we think, without hearing a sudden knock on the door. That we can have an idea and start our own business without paying a bribe or hiring somebody’s son. That we can participate in the political process without fear of retribution, and that our votes will he counted - or at least, most of the time.<br>这才是真正的美国智慧，坚信自己的国民有着朴素无华的梦想， 坚信点滴的奇迹终会出现在身边。入夜，当我们为孩子掖好小被的同时，相信他们不会为衣食所累，不会为安全担忧。我们可以畅所欲言，无需担心不速之客会不请自来。我们有灵感，有想法，可以去实现，去创业，无须行贿或雇佣某些人物的子女作为筹码和条件。我们可以参政议政，不必担心打击报复，我们的选票至关重要，至少多数情况下，都是如此。</p>
<p>This year, in this election, we are called to reaffirm our values and commitments, to hold them against a hard reality and see how we are measuring up, to the legacy of our forbearers, and the promise of future generations. And fellow Americans - Democrats, Republicans, Independents - I say to you tonight: we have more work to do. More to do for the workers I met in Gale□□urg, Illinois, who are losing their union jobs at the Maytag plant that’s moving to Mexico, and now are having to compete with their own children for jobs that pay seven bucks an hour. More to do for the father I met who was losing his job and choking back tears, wondering how he would pay $4,500 a month for the drugs his son needs without the health benefits he counted on. More to do for the young woman in East St. Louis, and thousands more like her, who has the grades, has the drive, has the will, but doesn’t have the money to go to college.<br>在今年的选举中，特别重申了我们主张的价值和肩负的责任，以此来应对当下的艰难现实：并希望了解怎样才能更好秉承前辈的遗产，实现对子孙的承诺。诸位美国国民，无论你是民主党，还是共和党，抑或是无党派人士，今晚我想对大家说的是：我们需要作的事情还有很多很多，在伊利诺伊州盖尔斯堡(Galesburg), 由于Maytag洗衣机厂要迁至墨西哥，很多工人将失去工作，而现在唯一的选择就是和自己的子女一起竞争每小时7美元的低薪工作。我曾遇到一位强忍泪水的父亲，他也因此丢掉了工作，没有了经济来源，不知怎样才能为儿子支付得起每月4500美元的高昂医药费用，本可救命的医疗保险对他而言却遥不可及，我们应该为他们做点什么；在东圣路易斯市，有这样一个年轻女孩，她品学兼优，成绩出色，却因为没有钱，无法完成学业，与大学无缘，而像她这样的孩子还有千千万万，我们应该为他们做点什么。</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong. The people I meet in small towns and big cities, in diners and office parks, they don’t expect government to solve all their problems. They know they have to work hard to get ahead and they want to. Go into the collar counties around Chicago, and people will tell you they don’t want their tax money wasted by a welfare agency or the Pentagon. Go into any inner city neighborhood, and folks will tell you that government alone can’t teach kids to learn. They know that parents have to parent, that children can’t achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white. No, people don’t expect government to solve all their problems. But they sense, deep in their bones, that with just a change in priorities, we can make sure that every child in America has a decent shot at life, and that the doors of opportunity remain open to all. They know we can do better. And they want that choice.<br>请正面理解我的意思。我在城市与乡镇，在餐厅和办公楼停车场，接触过很多民众，他们并不期待由政府出面，帮他们排忧解难。而是清楚地意识到，需要通过努力工作，去面对和解决所有的问题，而这也确实是他们真实的想法和愿望。走进芝加哥周边的城镇，大家会告诉你，希望自己辛苦缴纳的税款能够物尽其用，而不是让社会保障机构或五角大楼任意支配。走进市中心的街区，大家会告诉你，让孩子好好读书不能仅仅依靠政府的力量，父母也要尽职尽责，培养下一代，不让孩子整天沉溺于电视，对于黑人而言，更要和白人一样，让子女有接受教育的权利，而不是相反。人们并不是依赖政府来解决所有问题，但他们真诚地认为，只要政府把工作的重点有所调整，就可以使得每个孩子都能奋发图强，积极向上，让机遇大门向每个人敞开。他们深知，我们有能力做得更好，他们同样希望如此。</p>
<p>In this election, we offer that choice. Our party has chosen a man to lead us who embodies the best this country has to offer. That man is John Kerry. John Kerry understands the ideals of community, faith, and sacrifice, because they’ve defined his life. From his heroic service in Vietnam to his years as prosecutor and lieutenant governor, through two decades in the United States Senate, he has devoted himself to this country. Again and again, we’ve seen him make tough choices when easier ones were available. His values and his record affirm what is best in us.<br>在本次选举中，我们做出了这样的选择。民主党已选出一国之中品行最为高尚的人作为我们的领袖，带领大家实现这样的选择。他就是约翰•凯利, 他深刻地领悟了社区、信念和献身精神这些崇高的理想，因为这些铸就了他生命的全部。他曾在越南英勇作战，回国后出任过检察官和副州长，在美国参议院度过了20个春秋，把全部精力都投入到国家社稷大业之中。多少次，他面对艰难抉择，知难而上，不畏艰险，他的阅历和品行为我们树立了榜样。</p>
<p>John Kerry believes in an America where hard work is rewarded. So instead of offering tax breaks to companies shipping jobs overseas, he’ll offer them to companies creating jobs here at home. John Kerry believes in an America where all Americans can afford the same health coverage our politicians in Washington have for themselves. John Kerry believes in energy independence, so we aren’t held hostage to the profits of oil companies or the sabotage of foreign oil fields. John Kerry believes in the constitutional freedoms that have made our country the envy of the world, and he will never sacrifice our basic liberties nor use faith as a wedge to divide us. And John Kerry believes that in a dangerous world, war must be an option, but it should never he the first option.<br>约翰•凯利坚信，在美国，付出就会有回报，因此，对于那些在本土创造就业机会的公司，他会在税收上给与优惠，而将工作机会输送到海外的公司则不会享受到如此待遇。他坚信，美国应该实现标准的医疗保险，对普通百姓和华盛顿的政治家都一视同仁。他坚信能源自主的重要性，因此我们不会再因石油公司对利润的追求，或对国外油田的破坏而遭致威胁。他坚信美国应该成为世人艳羡的国度，因为国民的自由受到宪法的保护。他永远都不会让大家的基本自由受到影响，更不会以信仰为借口，来制造分裂。他还坚信当今世界的确存在危险因素，战争在所难免，但战争永远不会成为解决争端的首选。</p>
<p>A while back, I met a young man named Shamus at the VFW Hall in East Moline, Illinois. He was a good-looking kid, six-two or six-three, clear-eyed, with an easy smile. He told me he’d joined the Marines and was heading to Iraq the following week. As I listened to him explain why he’d enlisted, his absolute faith in our country and its leaders, his devotion to duty and service, I thought this young man was all any of us might hope for in a child. But then I asked myself: Are we serving Shamus as well as he was serving us?<br>前不久，在伊利诺伊州东莫林市的外战老兵俱乐部里，我偶遇一个年轻人，他叫沙莫斯，身高足有 2米，相貌英俊，目光清澈，笑容可掬。他说自己加入了海军陆战队, 一周后就将进驻伊拉克。当我听他讲述入伍的原因时，他讲到了对我们国家和领导人的绝对信赖，对军队的无上忠诚以及自身强烈的责任感，这让我感受到他身上具备的优良品质正是我们对子女的所有期待。然而，当我扪心自问：我们为他所做的一切，是否能与他的付出相当呢?</p>
<p>I thought of more than 900 service men and women, sons and daughters, husbands and wives, friends and neighbors, who will not be returning to their hometowns. I thought of families I had met who were struggling to get by without a loved one’s full income, or whose loved ones had returned with a limb missing or with nerves shattered, but who still lacked long-term health benefits because they were reservists. When we send our young men and women into harm’s way, we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why they’re going, to care for their families while they’re gone, to tend to the soldiers upon their return, and to never ever go to war without enough troops to win the war, secure the peace, and earn the respect of the world.<br>我想到这次战争中已有900多名军人战死沙场，他们也有自己的家人和邻友，也许已是为人父母，还有年迈的双亲，却再也无法回到这些关爱他们的人身边。我想到自己遇到的那些家庭，他们或是要应对亲人阵亡，收入锐减所来的经济窘境，或是要面对肢体残缺的家人复原归来，甚至精神崩溃，却因其预备役军人的身份而无法享受长期的健康补贴，生活变得举步维艰。当这些可爱的年轻人舍身踏上征程，我们责无旁贷地要确认做出出兵决定的所有数据和理由确凿无误；我们责无旁贷地要替他们照顾好家人，而当他们荣归故里时，要关照他们的生活；当决定要介入战争、保卫和平和赢得世界的尊重之时，我们责无旁贷地要派驻足够数量的军队，以确保战士能凯旋而归。</p>
<p>Now let me be clear. We have real enemies in the world. These enemies must be found. They must be pursued and they must be defeated. John Kerry knows this. And just as Lieutenant Kerry did not hesitate to risk his life to protect the men who served with him in Vietnam, President Kerry will not hesitate one moment to use our military might to keep America safe and secure. John Kerry believes in America. And he knows it’s not enough for just some of us to prosper. For alongside our famous individualism, there’s another ingredient in the American saga.<br>请允许我阐明下述观点：在世界上，确实有人与我们为敌，我们必须找到他们，并予以坚决打击，获取胜利。约翰•凯利深知这一点，正如身为上尉的他在越南战场上出生入死，保护自己的下属一样，若他身为总统，也同样会义无反顾地运用军队的力量确保国家的安全。他对美国充满信心，而且深知仅有部分公民实现生活的富足还远远不够，而这要仰仗与我们闻名于世的个人主义相伴的另一种元素，正是因为它们，美国史册才熠熠生辉。</p>
<p>A belief that we are connected as one people. If there’s a child on the south side of Chicago who can’t read, that matters to me, even if it’s not my child. If there’s a senior citizen somewhere who can’t pay for her prescription and has to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer, even if it’s not my grandmother. If there’s an Arab American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process, that threatens my civil liberties. It’s that fundamental belief - I am my brother’s keeper, I am my sister’s keeper - that makes this country work. It’s what allows us to pursue our individual dreams, yet still come together as a single American family. “E pluribus unum.” Out of many, one.<br>这就是我们作为一个民族荣辱与共的信仰。假如，芝加哥南部的一个孩子无法读书识字，即便他与我非亲非故，我也会心怀忐忑。如果有位老人因无法支付高昂的医疗费用，不得不在治病和租房之间痛苦抉择，即便她与我素未谋面，我也会如坐针毡，。假如，一个阿拉伯裔的美国家庭未经律师辩护，或诉讼程序就遭受不公正待遇，同样会让我寝食难安。正是这个基本信仰让这个国家发展到今天：我们都是一家人，我们都是兄弟姐妹。只有这样我们才能实现个人的梦想，才能成为一个美利坚大家庭。独木不成林，单弦不成音。</p>
<p>Yet even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes. Well, I say to them tonight, there’s not a liberal America and a conservative America - there’s the United States of America. There’s not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there’s the United States of America. The pundits like to slice-and-dice our country into Red States and Blue States; Red States for Republicans, Blue States for Democrats. But I’ve got news for them, too. We worship an awesome God in the Blue States, and we don’t like federal agents poking around our libraries in the Red States. We coach Little League in the Blue States and have gay friends in the Red States. There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq and patriots who supported it. We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.<br>当我们在这里聚会的时候，也有人正准备分裂我们，那些操纵舆论的人和制作负面宣传的人，他们投身没有原则和不择手段的政治。今晚，我需要对这些人讲得是，美国人没有所谓自由和保守之分，世间只存在一个美利坚合众国。更没有所谓美国白人黑人之分，拉丁裔和亚裔之分，有的只是美利坚合众国一国的国民。有博学家愿意将我们的国家分成红蓝两色，红色代表共和党，蓝色代表民主党。但我想说得是即便在民主党中，我们也都信奉万能的主，我们不喜欢联邦的机构在共和党中间对我们的藏书指指点点， 我们在民主党中也有人执教少年棒球联盟，在共和党中也有同性恋朋友，有爱国人士支持伊拉克战争，也有爱国人士反对就伊出兵。我们都是一国之民，都效忠于伟大的星条旗，所有的人都热爱我们的祖国——美利坚合众国。</p>
<p>In the end, that’s what this election is about. Do we participate in a politics of cynicism or a politics of hope?<br>说到底，这才是本次选举的意义所在：我们所参与的政治应该是愤世嫉俗还是充满希望?</p>
<p> John Kerry calls on us to hope. John Edwards calls on us to hope. I’m not talking about blind optimism here - the almost willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don’t talk about it, or the health care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it. No, I’m talking about something more substantial. It’s the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs; the hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores; the hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta; the hope of a millworker’s son who dares to defy the odds; the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too. The audacity of hope!<br>约翰•凯利号召我们要对未来满怀希望。这并不是说要盲目乐观。以为只要不谈论失业问题，这个问题就会自行消失；认为只要无视医疗危机的存在，它也会烟消云散。我所谈的是更为根本的问题。是因为存在希望，奴隶们围坐在火堆边，才会吟唱自由之歌；是因为存在希望才使得人们愿意远涉重洋，移民他乡；是因为希望，年轻的海军上尉才会在湄公河三角州勇敢的巡逻放哨，是因为希望，出身工人家庭的孩子才会敢于挑战自己的命运；是因为希望，我这个名字怪怪的瘦小子才相信美国这片热土上也有自己的容身之地。这就是无畏的希望。 </p>
<p>In the end, that is God’s greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation; the belief in things not seen; the belief that there are better days ahead. I believe we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with a road to opportunity. I believe we can provide jobs to the jobless, homes to the homeless, and reclaim young people in cities across America from violence and despair. I believe that as we stand on the crossroads of history, we can make the right choices, and meet the challenges that face us. America!<br>最后，感谢上苍赐予我们最好的礼物，也就是这个国家赖以生存的基石，因为我们相信最好的东西尚未出现，更好的日子就在明天，我相信我们可以为中产阶级减负，让工人家庭走上希望之路，我相信我们可以为无业者创造就业机会，为无家可归者带来可以遮风挡雨的屋顶，让美国城市中年轻人从暴力和绝望的阴影中走出来。我相信今天的我们就站在历史的十字街头，我们可以做出正确的选择，迎接面临的挑战。</p>
<p>Tonight, if you feel the same energy I do, the same urgency I do, the same passion I do, the same hopefulness I do - if we do what we must do, then I have no doubt that all across the country, from Florida to Oregon, from Washington to Maine, th people will rise up in November, and John Kerry will be sworn in as president, and John Edwards will be sworn in as vice presidentm and this country will reclaim its promise, and out of this long political darkness a brighter day will come. Thank you and God bless you.<br>今晚，如果你我感同身受，有同样的力量、同样的急迫感、同样的冲动和同样的希望；如果我们都能行动起来，那么我相信，从佛罗里达到俄勒冈，从华盛顿到缅因州，全国人民将会在11月积极行动起来，使得 约翰•凯利、约翰•爱德华兹分别宣誓就任总统、副总统之职，而国家也将就此走出低谷、重振旗鼓。暗夜即将过去，黎明即将到来。谢谢大家，愿上帝保佑你们。</p>

            <h2 id="奥巴马专题"><a href="#奥巴马专题" class="headerlink" title="奥巴马专题:"></a>奥巴马专题:</h2><hr>
<p>Tonight, more than 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny, the task of perfecting our union moves forward.<br>两百多年前，美国人民在这块曾经的殖民地上赢得了自己的命运，今夜，我们向实现完美联邦的目标又迈进了一步。</p>
<p>OBAMA: It moves forward because of you. It moves forward because you reaffirmed the spirit that has triumphed over war and depression, the spirit that has lifted this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope, the belief that while each of us will pursue our own individual dreams, we are an American family and we rise or fall together as one nation and as one people.<br>奥巴马：这一步是因为你们，这一步是因为你们证明了，克服战争和萧条的那种精神仍在，那份把我们国家从绝望的深渊带向希望之巅的精神，坚信我们每个人都可以追逐自己的梦想。美国同胞血浓于水，作为一个国家和民族，我们共起落，同荣辱。</p>
<p>Tonight, in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our road has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back, and we know in our hearts that for the United States of America the best is yet to come.<br>今晚，在这次选举中，你们，美国人民，提醒了我们尽管路程艰辛、路程漫长，我们仍能振作精神，奋起反击，我们心中坚信，最好的时代，还在等着美利坚。</p>
<p>OBAMA: I want to thank every American who participated in this election…<br>奥巴马：我想感谢每一位亲身参与大选的美国人。</p>
<p>… whether you voted for the very first time or waited in line for a very long time.<br>无论这是你的第一次投票或是在队伍中等待了很久。</p>
<p>By the way, we have to fix that.<br>顺便说一句，这个问题真是亟待解决。</p>
<p>Whether you pounded the pavement or picked up the phone…<br>无论你是步行前往，还是拿起电话</p>
<p>… whether you held an Obama sign or a Romney sign, you made your voice heard and you made a difference.<br>无论你举的牌子上写的是奥巴马还是罗姆尼，你都发出了你自己的声音，你也一样，创造了不同。</p>
<p>I just spoke with Governor Romney and I congratulated him and Paul Ryan on a hard-fought campaign.<br>我刚刚和罗姆尼州长通了电话，向他和保罗·瑞安，就这场艰难的战役表示了我的祝贺。</p>
<p>We may have battled fiercely, but it’s only because we love this country deeply and we care so strongly about its future. From George to Lenore to their son Mitt, the Romney family has chosen to give back to America through public service and that is the legacy that we honor and applaud tonight.<br>双方的选战或许惨烈，但这正是因为我们如此深爱这个国家。如此关心它的未来，从乔治到兰诺夫妇，再到他们的儿子米特，罗姆尼一家选择通过献身公务来回报美国。今晚，我们向这一份宝贵遗产献上尊敬和掌声。</p>
<p>In the weeks ahead, I also look forward to sitting down with Governor Romney to talk about where we can work together to move this country forward.<br>在未来的几个星期，我还希望能和罗姆尼州长坐下来讨论在哪些方面，我们可以共同努力，推动这个国家向前。</p>
<p>I want to thank my friend and partner of the last four years, America’s happy warrior, the best vice president anybody could ever hope for, Joe Biden.<br>我想谢谢我的朋友，我过去四年的搭档。美国的快乐战士，乔·拜登能有他做副总统，夫复何求。</p>
<p>OBAMA: And I wouldn’t be the man I am today without the woman who agreed to marry me 20 years ago.<br>奥巴马：另外，如果没有那位20年前同意嫁给我的女人，我今天也不可能站在这里。</p>
<p>Let me say this publicly: Michelle, I have never loved you more. I have never been prouder to watch the rest of America fall in love with you, too, as our nation’s first lady.<br>让我告诉所有人吧，米歇尔，我对你的爱是如此深切，我目睹着我之外的美国人爱上你，我对你作为美国第一夫人感到的骄傲，也是如此地深切。</p>
<p>Sasha and Malia, before our very eyes you’re growing up to become two strong, smart beautiful young women, just like your mom.<br>萨沙和玛利亚，就在我们的注视下，你们已经成长为两位坚强、智慧、美丽的年轻女士，就像你们的妈妈一样。</p>
<p>OBAMA: And I’m so proud of you guys. But I will say that for now one dog’s probably enough.<br>奥巴马：我真的为你们骄傲，不过我还是要说，就现在看，一条狗应该已经够了。</p>
<p>To the best campaign team and volunteers in the history of politics…<br>至政治史上最好的竞选团队和志愿者们</p>
<p>The best. The best ever. Some of you were new this time around, and some of you have been at my side since the very beginning.<br>你们是最好的，最最好的。你们中有些人是新加入的，有些人从一开始就与我们共同进退。<br>(APPLAUSE)<br>（掌声）</p>
<p>But all of you are family. No matter what you do or where you go from here, you will carry the memory of the history we made together and you will have the life-long appreciation of a grateful president. Thank you for believing all the way, through every hill, through every valley.<br>但你们都是我的家人，无论你是做什么的，以后还要做什么，你们都会带上这段我们的共同创造的历史，以及这位感恩的总统对你们一辈子的感激。谢谢你们的一路坚信，陪我翻过每座丘陵，穿越每座山谷。</p>
<p>You lifted me up the whole way and I will always be grateful for everything that you’ve done and all the incredible work that you put in.<br>一路走来，多亏你们的辅佐。我会永远为你们所付出的一切和所有卓越之至的工作而心怀感激。</p>
<p>I know that political campaigns can sometimes seem small, even silly. And that provides plenty of fodder for the cynics that tell us that politics is nothing more than a contest of egos or the domain of special interests. But if you ever get the chance to talk to folks who turned out at our rallies and crowded along a rope line in a high school gym, or saw folks working late in a campaign office in some tiny county far away from home, you’ll discover something else.<br>我知道有时候政治竞选看起来渺小甚至愚蠢，这为愤世嫉俗的人提供了许多素材，他们告诉我们政治不过是自负驱动的比赛，或是为特殊利益集团服务的猴戏。但如果你曾经同参加过我们的集会的普通人，或是在高中体育馆围线外排队的人们交谈过，或是看到在远离家乡的小郡县竞选办公室工作到很晚的人们，你一定会有新的认识。</p>
<p>OBAMA: You’ll hear the determination in the voice of a young field organizer who’s working his way through college and wants to make sure every child has that same opportunity.<br>奥巴马：你会听到一位半工半读的年轻人现场活动组织者声音中的坚定，想要让每一个孩子都和他有一样的机会。<br>(APPLAUSE)<br>（掌声）</p>
<p>You’ll hear the pride in the voice of a volunteer who’s going door to door because her brother was finally hired when the local auto plant added another shift.<br>你会听到一名志愿者声音中的骄傲，她挨家挨户地告诉每一个人她的哥哥终于有了工作，因为当地的汽车公司增加了一个轮班。</p>
<p>You’ll hear the deep patriotism in the voice of a military spouse whose working the phones late at night to make sure that no one who fights for this country ever has to fight for a job or a roof over their head when they come home.<br>你会听到一位军嫂声音中深切的爱国主义情怀，她深夜也不放下电话，就是为了要让每一位保家卫国的战士不用在回家后，为了一份工作一片屋檐，苦苦求而不得。<br>(APPLAUSE)<br>（掌声）</p>
<p>That’s why we do this. That’s what politics can be. That’s why elections matter. It’s not small, it’s big. It’s important. Democracy in a nation of 300 million can be noisy and messy and complicated. We have our own opinions. Each of us has deeply held beliefs. And when we go through tough times, when we make big decisions as a country, it necessarily stirs passions, stirs up controversy.<br>这就是我们做这些的原因。这是政治可能的样子，这就是为什么选举是重要的，它并不渺小，它是大事，很重要的大事。有三亿人口的国家，民主会显得喧哗、混乱、复杂，我们有自己的观点，每个人都有自己坚定的信仰。当面对困难的时期，当我们的国家需要作重大的决定时，它必然会激发热情，也会掀起争议。</p>
<p>That won’t change after tonight, and it shouldn’t. These arguments we have are a mark of our liberty. We can never forget that as we speak people in distant nations are risking their lives right now just for a chance to argue about the issues that matter, the chance to cast their ballots like we did today.<br>这些在今晚之后都不会改变，也不应该被改变。这些争论是我们自由的印记，我们永远不能忘记，就在此时此刻，在一些遥远的国家，人民正在冒着生命的危险，只为了能有讨论那些重要话题的机会，为了能有像我们今天这样投出自己一票的机会。<br>(APPLAUSE)<br>（掌声）</p>
<p>But despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America’s future. We want our kids to grow up in a country where they have access to the best schools and the best teachers.<br>尽管我们有不同，我们中的大多数，对美国的未来怀有一样的希望。我们希望自己的孩子成长在这样一个国家，他们能去到最好的学校，有最好的老师。</p>
<p>A country that lives up to its legacy as the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation, with all the good jobs and new businesses that follow.<br>它不会辜负前人留下的遗产，继续成为全球科技、探索、创新的领导者，有好的工作，新的产业随之而来。</p>
<p>OBAMA: We want our children to live in an America that isn’t burdened by debt, that isn’t weakened by inequality, that isn’t threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet.<br>奥巴马：我们希望自己孩子成长的美国不会被债务负累，不会因不平等有所削弱，也不会被地球变暖而带来的危害所威胁。<br>(APPLAUSE)<br>（掌声）</p>
<p>We want to pass on a country that’s safe and respected and admired around the world, a nation that is defended by the strongest military on earth and the best troops this - this world has ever known.<br>我们想要传承的，是一个安全、受全球尊敬和爱戴的国家。我们想要传承的，是一个由世界最强军事力量保卫，拥有最好的军队的国家。</p>
<p>But also a country that moves with confidence beyond this time of war, to shape a peace that is built on the promise of freedom and dignity for every human being. We believe in a generous America, in a compassionate America, in a tolerant America, open to the dreams of an immigrant’s daughter who studies in our schools and pledges to our flag.<br>同时，也是一个自信前行的国家，走出战争的阴霾，塑造和平景象，保障每个人的自由与尊严，我们相信美国是一个慷慨大度的国家，一个悲天悯人的国家，更是一个海纳百川的国家。我们要接纳在我国学习并对我们的国旗宣誓满怀梦想的移民。</p>
<p>To the young boy on the south side of Chicago who sees a life beyond the nearest street corner.<br>也要接纳，身处芝加哥南部市井之中却能志存高远的男孩。</p>
<p>To the furniture worker’s child in North Carolina who wants to become a doctor or a scientist, an engineer or an entrepreneur, a diplomat or even a president - that’s the future we hope for. That’s the vision we share. That’s where we need to go - forward.<br>还要接纳北卡州家具工人的孩子，他们梦想着成为医生、科学家、工程师、企业家、外交官，甚至是总统——那正是我们所期望的未来。是我们共同的愿景，是我们的目标——前进。</p>
<p>That’s where we need to go.<br>那是我们的目标。</p>
<p>Now, we will disagree, sometimes fiercely, about how to get there. As it has for more than two centuries, progress will come in fits and starts. It’s not always a straight line. It’s not always a smooth path.<br>对于如何实现这一目标我们可能会意见向左，有时分歧很大。两个多世纪以来，一直如此，我们总会断断续续地取得进步。前进的路线总有曲折，不会一直是平坦通途。</p>
<p>By itself, the recognition that we have common hopes and dreams won’t end all the gridlock or solve all our problems or substitute for the painstaking work of building consensus and making the difficult compromises needed to move this country forward. But that common bond is where we must begin. Our economy is recovering. A decade of war is ending. A long campaign is now over.<br>认识到我们拥有共同的希望和梦想，单靠这一点无法终结所有的政治僵局或解决我们所有的问题，即使建立共识，作出推动这个国家向前所必要的艰难妥协，这些艰辛的工作也无法得以替代。但我们必须以这一共同纽带为起点。我们的经济正在复苏，为期十年的战争已近尾声，一场漫长的竞选现已结束。<br>(APPLAUSE)<br>（掌声）</p>
<p>And whether I earned your vote or not, I have listened to you, I have learned from you, and you’ve made me a better president. And with your stories and your struggles, I return to the White House more determined and more inspired than ever about the work there is to do and the future that lies ahead.<br>无论我是否赢得了你的选票，我倾听了你的呼声，从你身上得到了教益，你是我成长为更优秀的总统。带着你们的故事和奋斗史，我回到白宫时，对面临的任务和未来，会更为坚定、更有激情。</p>
<p>Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual.<br>今晚，你们投票换来的将会是积极的行动，而不是以往那样的政治游戏。</p>
<p>You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours. And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties to meet the challenges we can only solve together. Reducing our deficit. Reforming our tax code. Fixing our immigration system. Freeing ourselves from foreign oil. We’ve got more work to do.<br>你们选择了我们，是让我们关注你们的就业， 而非我们自己的官位。在接下来的数周、数月中，我期待着与两党领袖进行接触与合作，共同应对我们必须携手攻克的难关。降低赤字，改革税法，完善移民体系，摆脱对进口石油的依赖，我们还有更多的工作要完成。<br>(APPLAUSE)<br>（掌声）</p>
<p>OBAMA: But that doesn’t mean your work is done. The role of citizens in our Democracy does not end with your vote. America’s never been about what can be done for us. It’s about what can be done by us together through the hard and frustrating, but necessary work of self-government. That’s the principle we were founded on.<br>奥巴马：但这并不意味着你们的任务已经结束，公民在我们的民主体系中所扮演的角色，并不止于投票。美利坚的意义并不在于别人能为我们做什么，而是在我们能一起做什么。而这依靠的就是公民自治，这虽然困难而又往往令人灰心，但却是不可或缺的。</p>
<p>This country has more wealth than any nation, but that’s not what makes us rich. We have the most powerful military in history, but that’s not what makes us strong. Our university, our culture are all the envy of the world, but that’s not what keeps the world coming to our shores.<br>这是我们的建国理念，我们国家的财富多于其他任何国家，但我们的富有并不源于此，我们有史上最强的军事力量，但这并不是我们力量的源头。我们的大学，我们的文化，为世界所歆羡，可这并非吸引各国人民前来我国的根源。</p>
<p>What makes America exceptional are the bonds that hold together the most diverse nation on earth. The belief that our destiny is shared; that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations. The freedom which so many Americans have fought for and died for come with responsibilities as well as rights. And among those are love and charity and duty and patriotism. That’s what makes America great.<br>真正让美国与众不同的，是将这个地球上最多元化的国家的人民团结到一起的那些纽带。是我们共命运的信念，是只有当我们肩负某些对彼此以及对后代的责任美国才能走下去的信念，是无数的美国人前赴后继为之奋斗的自由──它既赋予了我们权利，也给我们带来了责任；是爱、慈善、义务和爱国。正是这些让美国变得伟大。</p>
<p>I am hopeful tonight because I’ve seen the spirit at work in America. I’ve seen it in the family business whose owners would rather cut their own pay than lay off their neighbors, and in the workers who would rather cut back their hours than see a friend lose a job. I’ve seen it in the soldiers who reenlist after losing a limb and in those SEALs who charged up the stairs into darkness and danger because they knew there was a buddy behind them watching their back.<br>今晚，我满怀希望，因为我已经看到美国精神正在得以发扬。我看到有些家族企业，所有者宁可减少自己的薪酬也不愿让邻居丢掉工作；我看到有些工人宁愿缩减自己的工时也不愿看到朋友没有活干；我看到有些士兵在失去一条腿或胳膊之后又选择再次入伍；我看到海豹突击队员不避危险冲上楼梯、冲入黑暗，因为他们知道有一个兄弟在做他的后盾。<br>(APPLAUSE)<br>（掌声）</p>
<p>I’ve seen it on the shores of New Jersey and New York, where leaders from every party and level of government have swept aside their differences to help a community rebuild from the wreckage of a terrible storm. And I saw just the other day, in Mentor, Ohio, where a father told the story of his 8-year-old daughter, whose long battle with leukemia nearly cost their family everything had it not been for health care reform passing just a few months before the insurance company was about to stop paying for her care.<br>在新泽西和纽约的海岸，我也看到了美国精神。每一个政党和各级政府的领导者都捐弃分歧，为在骇人风暴过后的废墟上重建社区各尽己力。就在不久前的一天，在俄亥俄的门托，我看到一位父亲在讲述他8岁女儿的故事。这个女孩与白血病进行了长期的斗争，如果不是因为几个月前通过的医改法案，保险公司就会停止支付医疗费用，他们的家庭就将失去一切。</p>
<p>I had an opportunity to not just talk to the father, but meet this incredible daughter of his. And when he spoke to the crowd listening to that father’s story, every parent in that room had tears in their eyes, because we knew that little girl could be our own. And I know that every American wants her future to be just as bright. That’s who we are. That’s the country I’m so proud to lead as your president.<br>我曾有机会与这位父亲攀谈，不仅如此，我还见到了他的女儿，这个非常了不起的小姑娘。当这位父亲向倾听他的故事的人讲述时，每一位在场的父母的眼里都含着泪水，因为我们知道，我们自己的孩子也有可能遇到这种状况。而且我知道，每一位美国人都希望这位小女孩的未来能像所有人的未来一样光明。这就是美国人，这就是美国，我为自己能够成为这个国家的总统、带领这个国家前行感到无比光荣。</p>
<p>And tonight, despite all the hardship we’ve been through, despite all the frustrations of Washington, I’ve never been more hopeful about our future. I have never been more hopeful about America. And I ask you to sustain that hope. I’m not talking about blind optimism, the kind of hope that just ignores the enormity of the tasks ahead or the roadblocks that stand in our path. I’m not talking about the wishful idealism that allows us to just sit on the sidelines or shirk from a fight.<br>今晚，尽管我们遭遇了很多困难，尽管华盛顿有诸多不尽人意之处，我仍从未像现在这样对未来充满希望。我从未像现在这样对美国充满希望。我请大家也保持这样的希望。我所说的并非盲目的乐观主义，不是那种看不到眼前的任务有多么艰巨、看不到前行的路上有什么样的障碍的希望；我所说的并非作壁上观或是临战退缩的一厢情愿的理想主义。</p>
<p>I have always believed that hope is that stubborn thing inside us that insists, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that something better awaits us so long as we have the courage to keep reaching, to keep working, to keep fighting.<br>我一直相信，所谓希望就是我们内心倔强地坚持的力量，相信不管有多少相反的证据，都要相信有更好的东西在等着我们，只要我们有勇气不断前行、不懈工作、不停战斗。</p>
<p>America, I believe we can build on the progress we’ve made and continue to fight for new jobs and new opportunity and new security for the middle class. I believe we can keep the promise of our founders, the idea that if you’re willing to work hard, it doesn’t matter who you are or where you come from or what you look like or where you love. It doesn’t matter whether you’re black or white or Hispanic or Asian or Native American or young or old or rich or poor, able, disabled, gay or straight, you can make it here in America if you’re willing to try.<br>国民们，我相信我们有能力在已经取得的进步的基础上再进一步，继续为了给中产阶级创造新的工作、新的机遇、新的保障而战斗。我相信我们有能力信守开国者们许下的诺言，信守这样一种理念，那就是不管你是谁，不管你来自哪里，不管你长相如何，不管你爱着哪个地方，你所需要做的就是努力工作。不管你的肤色是黑是白，不管你是拉美裔、亚裔还是美国原住民，不管你年轻还是年老，富有还是贫穷，身体健全或是残障，同性恋还是异性恋，只要你愿意努力，就能够在美国大有作为。</p>
<p>I believe we can seize this future together because we are not as divided as our politics suggests. We’re not as cynical as the pundits believe. We are greater than the sum of our individual ambitions, and we remain more than a collection of red states and blue states. We are and forever will be the United States of America.<br>我相信我们有能力共同握住这样的未来，因为美国人民并不像政界那么严重分歧。美国人民不像某些饱学之士所认为的那样愤世嫉俗。美国的抱负并不是每一个美国人的抱负的简单加总，美国也不是红州和蓝州的简单联合。我们是美利坚合众国，我们将永远是美利坚合众国。</p>
<p>And together with your help and God’s grace we will continue our journey forward and remind the world just why it is that we live in the greatest nation on Earth.<br>有你们的帮助，有上帝的仁慈，我们将继续携手前行，让全世界知道我们生活在全球最伟大的国度的原因到底是什么。</p>
<p>Thank you, America. God bless you. God bless these United States.<br>谢谢你，国民们，上帝保佑你们，上帝保佑美国。</p>

            <p>I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.<br>Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of bad captivity.<br>But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we’ve come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.<br>In a sense we’ve come to our nation’s capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the “unalienable Rights” of “Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked “insufficient funds.”<br>But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so, we’ve come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.<br>We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God’s children.<br>It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro’s legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.<br>But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice: In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.<br>The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom.<br>We cannot walk alone.<br>And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead.<br>We cannot turn back.<br>There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, “When will you be satisfied?” We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro’s basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating “for whites only.” We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until “justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.”<br>I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. And some of you have come from areas where your quest — quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed.<br>Let us not wallow in the valley of despair, I say to you today, my friends.<br>And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.<br>I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.”<font color="red"><br>I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.<br>I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.<br>I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.<br>I have a dream today!<br>I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of “interposition” and “nullification” — one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.<br>I have a dream today!<br>I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; “and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.”?<br>This is our hope, and this is the faith that I go back to the South with.<br>With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith, we will be able to transform the jarring discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.</font><br>And this will be the day — this will be the day when all of God’s children will be able to sing with new meaning:<br>My country ‘tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing.<br>Land where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrim’s pride,<br>From every mountainside, let freedom ring!<br>And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.<br>And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.<br>Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.<br>Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of<br>Pennsylvania.<br>Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado.<br>Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California.<br>But not only that.<br>Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.<br>Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee.<br>Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.<br>From every mountainside, let freedom ring.<br>And when this happens, when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God’s children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual:<br>Free at last! Free at last!<br>Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!</p>
<p>今天，我高兴地同大家一起参加这次将成为我国历史上为争取自由而举行的最伟大的示威集会。<br>100年前，一位伟大的美国人—今天我们就站在他的雕像前—签署了《解放黑奴宣言》。这项重要法令的颁布，对于千百万灼烤于非正义残焰中的黑奴，犹如带来希望之光的硕大灯塔，恰似结束漫漫长夜禁锢的欢畅黎明。<br>然而100年后的今天，我们必须正视黑人还没有得到自由这一悲惨的事实。100年后的今天，在种族隔离的镣铐和种族歧视的枷锁下，黑人的生活备受压榨。100年后的今天，黑人仍生活在物质充裕的海洋中一个穷困的孤岛上。100年后的今天，黑人仍然蜷缩在美国社会的角落里，并且意识到自己是故土家园中的流亡者。今天我们在这里集会，就是要把这种骇人听闻的情况公诸世人。<br>就某种意义而言，今天我们是为了要求兑现诺言而汇集到我们国家的首都来的。我们共和国的缔造者草拟宪法和独立宣言的气壮山河的词句时，曾向每一个美国人许下了诺言，他们承诺所有人—不论白人还是黑人—都享有不可让渡的生存权、自由权和追求幸福权。<br>就有色公民而论，美国显然没有实践她的诺言。美国没有履行这项神圣的义务，只是给黑人开了一张空头支票，支票上盖着“资金不足”的戳子后便退了回来。但是我们不相信正义的银行已经破产，我们不相信，在这个国家巨大的机会之库里已没有足够的储备。因此今天我们要求将支票兑现——这张支票将给予我们宝贵的自由和正义保障。<br>我们来到这个圣地也是为了提醒美国，现在是非常急迫的时刻。现在绝非奢谈冷静下来或服用渐进主义的镇静剂的时候。现在是实现民主的诺言时候。现在是从种族隔离的荒凉阴暗的深谷攀登种族平等的光明大道的时候，现在是向上帝所有的儿女开放机会之门的时候，现在是把我们的国家从种族不平等的流沙中拯救出来，置于兄弟情谊的磐石上的时候。<br>如果美国忽视时间的迫切性和低估黑人的决心，那么，这对美国来说，将是致命伤。自由和平等的爽朗秋天如不到来，黑人义愤填膺的酷暑就不会过去。1963年并不意味着斗争的结束，而是开始。有人希望，黑人只要撒撒气就会满足；如果国家安之若素，毫无反应，这些人必会大失所望的。黑人得不到公民的基本权利，美国就不可能有安宁或平静，正义的光明的一天不到来，叛乱的旋风就将继续动摇这个国家的基础。<br>但是对于等候在正义之宫门口的心急如焚的人们，有些话我是必须说的。在争取合法地位的过程中，我们不要采取错误的做法。我们不要为了满足对自由的渴望而抱着敌对和仇恨之杯痛饮。我们斗争时必须永远举止得体，纪律严明。我们不能容许我们的具有崭新内容的抗议蜕变为暴力行动。我们要不断地升华到以精神力量对付物质力量的崇高境界中去。<br>现在黑人社会充满着了不起的新的战斗精神，但是不能因此而不信任所有的白人。因为我们的许多白人兄弟已经认识到，他们的命运与我们的命运是紧密相连的，他们今天参加游行集会就是明证。他们的自由与我们的自由是息息相关的。我们不能单独行动。<br>当我们行动时，我们必须保证向前进。我们不能倒退。现在有人问热心民权运动的人，“你们什么时候才能满足？”<br>只要黑人仍然遭受警察难以形容的野蛮迫害，我们就绝不会满足。<br>只要我们在外奔波而疲乏的身躯不能在公路旁的汽车旅馆和城里的旅馆找到住宿之所，我们就绝不会满足。<br>只要黑人的基本活动范围只是从少数民族聚居的小贫民区转移到大贫民区，我们就绝不会满足。<br>只要我们的孩子被“仅限白人”的标语剥夺自我和尊严，我们就绝不会满足。<br>只要密西西比州仍然有一个黑人不能参加选举，只要纽约有一个黑人认为他投票无济于事，我们就绝不会满足。<br>不！我们现在并不满足，我们将来也不满足，除非正义和公正犹如江海之波涛，汹涌澎湃，滚滚而来。<br>我并非没有注意到，参加今天集会的人中，有些受尽苦难和折磨，有些刚刚走出窄小的牢房，有些由于寻求自由，曾在居住地惨遭疯狂迫害的打击，并在警察暴行的旋风中摇摇欲坠。你们是人为痛苦的长期受难者。坚持下去吧，要坚决相信，忍受不应得的痛苦是一种赎罪。<br>让我们回到密西西比去，回到亚拉巴马去，回到南卡罗来纳去，回到佐治亚去，回到路易斯安那去，回到我们北方城市中的贫民区和少数民族居住区去，要心中有数，这种状况是能够也必将改变的。<br>我们不要陷入绝望而不可自拔。朋友们，今天我对你们说，在此时此刻，我们虽然遭受种种困难和挫折，我仍然有一个梦想，这个梦想深深扎根于美国的梦想之中。<br>我梦想有一天，这个国家会站立起来，真正实现其信条的真谛：“我们认为真理是不言而喻，人人生而平等。”<br>我梦想有一天，在佐治亚的红山上，昔日奴隶的儿子将能够和昔日奴隶主的儿子坐在一起，共叙兄弟情谊。<br>我梦想有一天，甚至连密西西比州这个正义匿迹，压迫成风，如同沙漠般的地方，也将变成自由和正义的绿洲。<br>我梦想有一天，我的四个孩子将在一个不是以他们的肤色，而是以他们的品格优劣来评价他们的国度里生活。<br>今天，我有一个梦想。我梦想有一天，亚拉巴马州能够有所转变，尽管该州州长现在仍然满口异议，反对联邦法令，但有朝一日，那里的黑人男孩和女孩将能与白人男孩和女孩情同骨肉，携手并进。<br>今天，我有一个梦想。<br>我梦想有一天，幽谷上升，高山下降；坎坷曲折之路成坦途，圣光披露，满照人间。<br>这就是我们的希望。我怀着这种信念回到南方。有了这个信念，我们将能从绝望之岭劈出一块希望之石。有了这个信念，我们将能把这个国家刺耳的争吵声，改变成为一支洋溢手足之情的优美交响曲。<br>有了这个信念，我们将能一起工作，一起祈祷，一起斗争，一起坐牢，一起维护自由；因为我们知道，终有一天，我们是会自由的。<br>在自由到来的那一天，上帝的所有儿女们将以新的含义高唱这支歌：“我的祖国，美丽的自由之乡，我为您歌唱。您是父辈逝去的地方，您是最初移民的骄傲，让自由之声响彻每个山岗。”<br>如果美国要成为一个伟大的国家，这个梦想必须实现！</p>
<p>让自由之声从新罕布什尔州的巍峨的崇山峻岭响起来！<br>让自由之声从纽约州的崇山峻岭响起来！<br>让自由之声从宾夕法尼亚州的阿勒格尼山响起来！<br>让自由之声从科罗拉多州冰雪覆盖的落基山响起来！<br>让自由之声从加利福尼亚州蜿蜒的群峰响起来！<br>不仅如此，还要让自由之声从佐治亚州的石岭响起来！<br>让自由之声从田纳西州的瞭望山响起来！<br>让自由之声从密西西比的每一座丘陵响起来！<br>让自由之声从每一片山坡响起来！<br>当我们让自由之声响起，让自由之声从每一个大小村庄、每一个州和每一个城市响起来时，我们将能够加速这一天的到来，那时，上帝的所有儿女，黑人和白人，犹太教徒和非犹太教徒，耶稣教徒和天主教徒，都将手携手，合唱一首古老的黑人灵歌：<br>“自由啦！自由啦！感谢全能上帝，我们终于自由啦!”</p>

            <p>Thank you.<br>I’m honored to be with you today for your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. Truth be told, I never graduated from college, and this is the closest I’ve ever gotten to a college graduation. Today, I want to tell you three stories from my life. That’s it. No big deal. Just three stories.</p>
<p>The first story is about connecting the dots. I dropped out of Reed College after the first six months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out?</p>
<p>It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife — except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl.</p>
<p>So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking, “We’ve got an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?” They said, “Of course.” My biological mother found out later that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would go to college. This was the start in my life.</p>
<p>And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents’ savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn’t see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life.</p>
<p>So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out okay. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn’t interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting.</p>
<p>It wasn’t all romantic. I didn’t have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends’ rooms. I returned coke bottles for the five cent deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the seven miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on. Let me give you one example:</p>
<p>Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn’t have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can’t capture, and I found it fascinating.</p>
<p>None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the “Mac” would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it’s likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on that calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backwards 10 years later.</p>
<p>Again, you can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever — because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart, even when it leads you off the well-worn path, and that will make all the difference.</p>
<p>My second story is about love and loss.</p>
<p>I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz1 and I started Apple in my parents’ garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a two billion dollar company with over 4000 employees. We’d just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just turned 30.</p>
<p>And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. And so at 30, I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.</p>
<p>I really didn’t know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down — that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me: I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over.</p>
<p>I didn’t see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.</p>
<p>During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the world’s first computer-animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, and I retuned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple’s current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn’t been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometime life — Sometimes life going to hit you in the head with a brick. Don’t lose faith. I’m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You’ve got to find what you love.</p>
<p>And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking — and don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it. And like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking — don’t settle.</p>
<p>My third story is about death.</p>
<p>When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: “If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you’ll most certainly be right.” It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I’ve looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: “If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?” And whenever the answer has been “No” for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.</p>
<p>Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure — these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.</p>
<p>About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn’t even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor’s code for “prepare to die.” It means to try and tell your kids everything you thought you’d have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes.</p>
<p>I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and, thankfully, I’m fine now.</p>
<p>This was the closest I’ve been to facing death, and I hope it’s the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept: No one wants to die.</p>
<p>Even people who want to go to heaven don’t want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It’s Life’s change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it’s quite true.</p>
<p>Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.</p>
<p>When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the “bibles” of my generation. It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch. This was in the late 60s, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and Polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along. It was idealistic, overflowing with neat tools and great notions.</p>
<p>Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words: “Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.” It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. And I’ve always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.</p>
<p>Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.</p>
<p>Thank you all very much.</p>

            <p>Nothing filled me with greater anxieties than that of which the notification was transmitted by your order, and received on the 14th day of the present month.On the one hand, I was summoned by my country, whose voice I can never hear but with veneration and love, from a retreat which I had chosen with the fondest predilection, and, in my flattering hopes, with an immutable decision, as the asylum of my declining years a retreat which was rendered every day more necessary as well as more dear to me by the addition of habit to inclination, and of frequent interruptions in my health to the gradual waste committed on it by time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature, and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.In this conflict of emotions all I dare aver is that it has been my faithful study to collect, my duty from a just appreciation of every circumstance by which it might be affected. All I dare hope is that if, in executing this task, I have been too much swayed by a grateful remembrance of former instances, or by an affectionate sensibility to this transcendent proof of the confidence of my fellow citizens, and have thence too little consulted my incapacity as well as disinclination for the weighty and untried cares before me, my error will be palliated by the motives which mislead me,and its consequences be judged by my country with some share of the partiality in which they originated.</p>
<p>Such being the impressions under which I have, in obedience to the public summons, repaired to the present station, it would be peculiarly improper to omit in this first official act my fervent supplications to that Almighty Being who rules over the universe, who presides in the councils of nations, and whose providential aids supply every human defect, that His benediction may consecrate to the liberties and happiness of the people of the United States a Government instituted by themselves for these essential purposes, and may enable every instrument employed in its administration to execute with success the functions allotted to his charge.</p>
<p>In tendering this homage to the Great Author of every public and private good, I assure myself that it expresses your sentiments not less than my own, nor those of my fellow citizens at large less than either. No people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the Invisible Hand which conducts the affairs of men more than those of the United States. Every step by which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation seems to have been distinguished by some token of providential agency; and in the important revolution just accomplished in the system of their united government the tranquil deliberations, along with an humble anticipation of the future blessings which the past seem to presage.These reflections, arising out of the present crisis, have forced themselves too strongly on my mind to be suppressed.</p>
<p>You will join with me, I trust, in thinking that there are none under the influence of which the proceedings of a new and free government can more auspiciously commence. By the article establishing the executive department it is made the duty of the President, “to recommend to your consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.”The circumstances under which I now meet you will acquit me from entering into that subject further than to refer to the great constitutional charter under which you are assembled, and which, in defining your powers, designates the objects to which your attention is to be given. It will be more consistent with those circumstances, and far more congenial with the feelings which actuate me, to substitute, in place of a recommendation of particular measures, the tribute that is due to the talents, the rectitude, and the patriotism which adorn the characters selected to devise and adopt them.</p>
<p>In these honorable qualifications I behold the surest pledges that as on one side no local prejudices or attachments, no separate views nor party animosities, will misdirect the comprehensive and equal eye which ought to watch over this great assemblage of communities and interests, so ,on another, that the foundation of our national policy will be laid in the pure and immutable principles of private morality, and the preeminence of free government be exemplified by all the attributes which can win the affections of its citizens and command the respect of the world.I dwell on this prospect with every satisfaction which an ardent love for my country can inspire, since there is no truth more thoroughly established than that there exists in the economy and course of nature an indissoluble union between virtue and happiness; between duty and advantage; between the genuine maxims of an honest and magnanimous policy and the solid rewards of public prosperity and felicity; since we ought to be no a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which Heaven itself has ordained; and since the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered, perhaps, as deeply, as finally, staked on the experiment entrusted on the hands of the American people.</p>
<p>在人生沉浮中，没有一件事能比你们于本月14日送达的通知更使我焦虑不安。一方面，国家召唤我出任此职，对于她的召唤，我永远只能肃然敬从；而隐退是我以挚爱心情、满腔希望和坚定的决心选择的暮年归宿，由于爱好和习惯，时感体力不济，愈觉隐退之必要和可贵。且时光流逝，健康渐衰。</p>
<p>另一方面，国家召唤我担负的责任如此重大和艰巨，足以使国内最有才智和经验的人度德量力；而我天资愚钝，又无民政管理的实践，理应倍觉自己能力之不足，因而必然感到难以肩此重任。怀着这种矛盾心情，我唯一敢断言的是，通过正确估计可能产生影响的各种情况来克尽吾职，乃是我忠贞不渝的努力目标。我唯一敢祈望的是，如果我在执行这项任务时因陶醉于往事。或因由衷感激公民们对我的高度信赖，因而受到过多影响，以致在处理从未经历过的大事时，忽视了自己的无能和消极。我的错误将会由于使我误人歧途的各种动机而减轻，而大家在评判错误的后果时，也会适当包涵产生这些动机的偏见。</p>
<p>既然这就是我在遵奉公众召唤就任现职时的感想，那么，在此宣誓就职之际，如不热忱地祈求全能的上帝就极其失当。因为上帝统治着宇宙，主宰着各国政府，它的神助能弥补人类的任何不足。愿上帝赐福，保佑一个为美国人民的自由和幸福而组成的政府，保佑它为这些基本目标而做出奉献。保佑政府的各项行政措施在我负责之下都能成功地发挥作用。</p>
<p>在向公众利益和私人利益的伟大缔造者献上这份崇敬时，我保证这不仅表达了我自己的情感，这些话也同样表达了各位和广大公民的心意。没有人能比美国更坚定不移地承认和崇拜掌管人间事务的上帝。他们在迈向独立国家的进程中，似乎每走一步都有某种天佑的迹象；他们在刚刚完成的联邦政府体制的重大改革中，如果不是因虔诚的感恩而得到某种回报，如果不是谦卑地期待着过去有所预示的赐福的到来，那么，通过众多截然不同的集团的冷静思考和自愿赞同来完成改革，这种方式是不能与大多数政府的组建方式同日而语的。</p>
<p>在目前转折关头，我产生这些想法确实是深有所感而不能自已。我相信大家会和我怀有同感，即除了仰仗上帝的力量，一个新生的自由政府别无他法能一开始就事事顺利。根据设立行政部门的条款，总统有责任对你们提出建议。如衡量权宜必要的判断之类的思路。但在目前与各位见面的这个场合，恕我不能进一步讨论这个问题，而只是提一下伟大的宪法，它使各位今天聚集一堂，它规定了各位的权限，提出了各位应该注意的目标。在这样的场合，更恰当、也更能反映我内心激情的做法。不是提出具体措施，而是称颂将要规划和采纳这些措施的当选者的才能、正直和爱国心。</p>
<p>我从这些高贵品格中看到了最可靠的保证：其一，任何地方偏见或地方感情，任何意见分歧或党派敌视，都不能使我们偏离全局观念和公平观点，即必须维护这个由不同地区和不同利益所组成的大联合；因为，其二，我国政策将会以纯洁而坚定的个人道德原则为基础，而自由政府将会以那赢得民心和全世界尊敬的一切特点而显示其优越性。我对国家的一片热爱之心激励着我满怀喜悦地展望这幅远景，因为根据自然界的构成和发展趋势，在美德与幸福之间，有着密不可分的统一；责任与利益之间，恪守诚实宽厚的政策与获得社会繁荣幸福的硕果之间，因为我们应该同样相信，上帝亲自规定了永恒的秩序和权利法则，它决不可能对无视这些法则的国家仁慈地加以赞许；因为人们理所当然地、满怀觉悟地，也许是最后一次把维护神圣的自由之火和共和制政府的命运，系于美国人所遵命进行的实验上。</p>

            <p>Fellow-Countrymen：</p>
<p>　　At this second appearing to take the oath of the Presidential office there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first. Then a statement somewhat in detail of a course to be pursued seemed fitting and proper. Now, at the expiration of four years, during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies of the nation, little that is new could be presented. The progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is as well known to the public as to myself, and it is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all. With high hope for the future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured.</p>
<p>　　On the occasion corresponding to this, four years ago all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war. All dreaded it, all sought to avert it. While the inaugural address was being delivered from this place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war, insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war-seeking to dissolve the Union and divide effects by negotiation. Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war came.</p>
<p>　　One-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the southern part of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war. To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the Union even by war, while the Government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it. Neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained. Neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with or even before the conflict itself should cease. Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and astounding. Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God, and each invokes His aid against the other. It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God’s assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men’s faces, but let us judge not, that we be not judged. The prayers of both could not be answered. That of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes. “Woe unto the world because of offenses; for it must needs be that offenses come, but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh.”[1] If we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offenses which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued through His appointed time, He now wills to remove, and that He gives to both North and South this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offense came, shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living God always ascribe to Him? Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman’s two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said “the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.”[2]</p>
<p>　　With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation’s wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.</p>
<p>同胞们：</p>
<p>　　这是我第二次宣誓就任总统，所以不太适合像第一次就职那样作长篇的演讲。初次就职时比较适合较为详细地叙述我们要追求的道路。而现在，我的四年任期刚刚结束。在这四年里，对于这场旷日持久、举国瞩目的斗争的方方面面，我一直不断地发表公开宣言，所以也没有什么新的内容要讲。军事力量是决定一切的关键，这方面的进展，大家跟我一样熟知，并且我相信，大家也对此感到满意和鼓舞。既然我们对未来抱有很大希望，那么在军事方面也就无须再做什么预言。</p>
<p>　　四年前我初次就职之时，所有的想法和忧虑都集中在即将爆发的内战问题上。大家害怕内战，都设法避免它的发生。当时我在此发表的就职演说，全部致力于不战而拯救联邦，然而，这座城市里的造反派却企图通过主张不战而摧毁联邦，他们企图通过妥协和谈判来瓦解联邦，瓜分这个国家。两方都反对战争，但其中一方宁愿发动战争也不愿联邦存续，而另一方不愿看到联邦解体，所以他们宁肯接受战争，于是内战就爆发了。</p>
<p>　　我国八分之一的人口是黑奴，他们并非不是广泛分布于全国各地，而是集中在美国南部。这些黑奴带来了一种特殊而强大的利益。所有人都知道这种利益迟早会成为战争的起因。为了加强、延续和扩展这种利益，造反派不惜发动战争分裂联邦，而政府所做的仅仅是要求将奴隶制限于原来区域，不能再扩张。双方都未曾料到战争会发展到这么大的规模，会持续这么久，也不觉得引起冲突的原因会在冲突本身停止时或者停止前就消失。双方都想轻而易举地得到胜利，也不想执着于一个彻底或让世人震惊的结果。双方读的是同一本圣经，向同一位上帝祷告，都诉求上帝帮助自己战胜对方。看起来很奇怪吧，居然有人敢请求公正的上帝帮助自己去榨取他人的血汗，掠夺他人的劳动成果；但我们还是不要随意鉴定吧，以免我们自己也被人说三道四。双方的祈求上帝不能回应，也没有任何一方得到满意的回应，因为全能的上帝自有他的主张。“苦难降临于世，是因为人犯下了罪过，因为人注定要犯错，然而苦难只降临在那些带来罪过的人身上。”我们如果肯相信奴隶制是那些罪过之一，是按照上帝的旨意降给我们的罪过，而这罪过已经到了上帝指定的期限，上帝现在要让这罪过消失，所以他把这场可怕的战争给予南北双方，他要惩罚那些犯下罪过的人们，那么笃信上帝并把许多神圣的属性赋予上帝的信徒们能说上帝的行为与他的神圣相违背吗？我们满怀着希望，我们热忱地祈祷，愿这战争的鞭笞早日过去。然而，假如上帝要这场战争延续下去，直至两百五十年来利用奴隶的无偿劳动所积聚的财富全部散尽，直至奴隶在皮鞭下流淌的每一滴血都用刀剑下的血来偿还，那么，如同三千年前《圣经》中所说的，“我们仍要称颂上帝的判决是公允合理的。”</p>
<p>　　我们对任何人都没有恶意，对所有人都怀有善心，我们坚信上帝赋予了我们明辨是非的能力，让我们努力完成我们正在进行的事业，包扎这个国家的伤痕，关怀每一位战死的烈士和他的妻儿，尽一切力量争取和维护我们国家及各个国家公正且长久的和平.</p>

            <p>Gettysburg Address 林肯在葛底斯堡的演说<br>（Delivered on the 19th Day of November, 1863 Cemetery Hill, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania ）</p>
<p>Fourscore and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new Nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now, we are engaged in a great Civil War, testing whether that Nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting-place for those who here gave their lives that Nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.<br>But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us, the living, rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us; that from these honored dead, we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion; that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this Nation, under GOD, shall have a new birth of freedom; and that government of the People by the People and for the People shall not perish from the earth.</p>
<p>87年前，我们的先辈们在这个大陆上创立了一个新国家，它孕育于自由之中，奉行一切人生来平等的原则。现在我们正从事一场伟大的内战，以考验这个国家，或者任何一个孕育于自由和奉行上述原则的国家是否能够长久存在下去。我们在这场战争中的一个伟大战场上集会。烈士们为使这个国家能够生存下去而献出了自己的生命，我们来到这里，是要把这个战场的一部分奉献给他们作为最后安息之所。我们这样做是完全应该而且是非常恰当的。<br>但是，从更广泛的意义上来说，这块土地我们不能够奉献，不能够圣化，不能够神化。那些曾在这里战斗过的勇士们，活着的和去世的，已经把这块土地圣化了，这远不是我们微薄的力量所能增减的。我们今天在这里所说的话，全世界不大会注意，也不会长久地记住，但勇士们在这里所做过的事，全世界却永远不会忘记。毋宁说，倒是我们这些还活着的人，应该在这里把自己奉献于勇士们已经如此崇高地向前推进但尚未完成的事业。倒是我们应该在这里把自己奉献于仍然留在我们面前的伟大任务—我们要从这些光荣的死者身上汲取更多的献身精神，来完成他们已经完全彻底为之献身的事业；我们要在这里下定最大的决心，不让这些死者白白牺牲；我们要使国家在上帝福佑下得到自由的新生，要使这个民有、民治、民享的政府永世长存。</p>

<p>数据摘要:One of the crucial requirements before comsuming datasets for any application is to understand the dataset at hand and its metadata.[1]<br>Data profiling is the set of activities and processes to determine the meta-data about a given dataset.[1]</p>
<p>总体地说,数据概要可以描述为是能够描述原样本数据的一个子集或者结果.比较简单地一种方式是计算平均值,总和或者统计频率最高的一些值等等方式.而较为有挑战性的是,在多列数据中找出其之间的相互函数或次序依赖等等关系.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>传统的数据摘要包括data exploration/data cleansing/data integration.而之后,data management和big data analytics也开始出现.</p>
<p>特别地,因为大数据的数据量大,多样性等特性,传统的技术对于其查询,存储及聚合都是花费高昂的.所以,data profiling在这里就显得非常重要.</p>

<p>Data profiling is an important preparatory task to determine which data to mine, how to import data into various tools, and how to interpret the results.[1]</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>i.e.</em><font color="red">给定一个包含正例和反例的样本集合，svm的目的是寻找一个超平面来对样本进行分割，把样本中的正例面和反例面分开，但不是简单的分开，原则是使正例和反例之间的间隔最大，鲁棒性最好。</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>2.<em>基本公式</em>：在样本空间中，划分超平面的线性方程：<img src="https://github.com/DuncanZhou/images/raw/master/1.PNG" alt="线性方程"><br>样本空间中任意点x到超平面（w，b）距离为<img src="https://github.com/DuncanZhou/images/raw/master/2.PNG" alt="距离"><br>假设正确分类，<img src="https://github.com/DuncanZhou/images/raw/master/3.PNG" alt="">“间隔”为<img src="https://github.com/DuncanZhou/images/raw/master/4.PNG" alt=""><br>所以，现在的目标是求得<em>“最大间隔”</em><img src="https://github.com/DuncanZhou/images/raw/master/5.PNG" alt=""><br>这就是SVM的基本型。</p>

<p><em>软间隔</em>：现实任务中往往很难确定合适的核函数使训练集在特征空间中线性可分，即使恰好找到了某个核函数使训练集在特征空间中线性可分，也很难判定这个貌似线性可分的结果不是由于过拟合所造成的。</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>解决该问题的一个方法是允许svm在一些样本上出错</em>。如<img src="https://github.com/DuncanZhou/images/raw/master/11.PNG" alt=""></p>
<p>也就是在求解最大化间隔时，同时使不满足约束的样本尽可能少。<img src="https://github.com/DuncanZhou/images/raw/master/15.PNG" alt=""></p>
